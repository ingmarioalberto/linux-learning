Exercises to learn linux by example

Even many of these examples could be done with docker instances, i won't go that way, i will be working with virtual machines, very small ones based mostly on rocky linux because RHEL is still the enterprise linux standard OS and maybe we could be highlighting those slight differences between ubuntu (debian based) and Rocky (red hat based)
The content of this quick course, is intended for newbies, i will try to explain what we do as linux sysadmins using everyday people's tasks trying that anyone be able to understand what we do,  how we do what we do, how to detect and solve common problems, and maybe try to explain how I think in order to do what I do, with some practical examples.
